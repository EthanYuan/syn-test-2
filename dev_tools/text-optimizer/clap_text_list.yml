    This parameter specifies the hash of a block. \
            When the height does not reach this block's height, the execution of the script will be disabled, \
            that is, skip verifying the script content. \
            \
            It should be noted that when this option is enabled, the header is first synchronized to \
            the highest currently found. During this period, if the assume valid target is found, \
            the download of the block starts; If the assume valid target is not found or it's \
            timestamp within 24 hours of the current time, the target will automatically become invalid, \
            and the download of the block will be started with verify
